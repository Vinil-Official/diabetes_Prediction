## Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can prevent severe health complications.  
This project uses **KNN Classifier** to predict diabetes based on features like glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

| Feature         | Description                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Pregnancies     | Number of times pregnant                       |
| Glucose         | Plasma glucose concentration                   |
| BloodPressure   | Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)              |
| SkinThickness   | Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)               |
| Insulin         | 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)                |
| BMI             | Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)|
| DiabetesPedigreeFunction | Diabetes pedigree function            |
| Age             | Age of the individual                          |
| Outcome         | Target variable (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)|

## Algorithm
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** predicts the class (diabetic or not) based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors.  

**Why KNN?**
- Simple and effective for classification  
- Non-parametric and easy to interpret  
- Works well with small to medium datasets

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** ~ (insert your model accuracy here)  
- Evaluated using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
